When a person was infected and the source was known, that was considered a connection, and was represented as a curved line.\r\n\r\nSee where outbreaks could occur. The clusters of people, created based on the connections, could reveal possible hot spots and could help us discover the locations and the circumstances that can lead to outbreaks.\r\n\r\nExplore. Hover over each person to see how many people got in contact with, more details, and the link to the original media article.

This kind of visualization would highlight the clusters of cases that could lead to outbreaks, and would require more attention from the officials.\r\n\r\nIn March, I have seen an article on Kontinentalist on how cases were related in Singapore, so I offered to create a similar graphic, for Romania. I made a new Github repository, created an initial graph, checked in the free code and exposed it through gh-pages.\r\n\r\nThe best way to show the relations between people was a Network Diagram, or a force layout in D3.js world.",
    "more_details": "I’ve set the D3.js forces simulation so that nodes would be displayed around a center of gravity, the cases would be drawn as points, the links between them as lines, and attraction-rejection force algorithms would automatically distribute all the elements in the drawing space (or canvas).\r\n\r\nI had to find a workaround to add the source countries to the simulation, and at some point we decided to leave out the nodes that were not linked to other community cases.\r\n\r\nThen, I wrapped the code in a JavaScript framework, svelte, and I’ve added different features to the app, that I thought would be useful: display on the map, cluster the cases per county, display the cases on a timeline graph, ordered by day and stacked. Layouts by screen resolution, legends, navigation – zoom and pan, a play button that would step through each case, pop-up info about the case, web link to the source article, display the labels by zoom. Coloring by county, gender, age, status.",

    "project_solution": "I have downloaded free point cloud data from OpenTopography, and also free and complete GIS data for Yosemite National Park from IRMA (Integrated Resource Management Applications) Datastore, and inspected the region using NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) aerial data. \r\n\r\nI have used PDAL to merge the files, reproject to the same coordinate system, create tiles, extract ground points and denoise the tiles using a series of commands in batch. Then I went to ESRI’s ArcMap 3.7, imported all resulting ground tiles to a new LAS dataset and continued the analysis.\r\n\r\nFrom the 3D model, I have derived raster image files and extracted the climbing walls: outlined the morphologic characteristics of the ground surface (slope), identified the areas with steep slope above 75° and created a cluster of similar zones using raster image generalization algorithms.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have determined the walls length using a flow direction and stream identification algorithms to obtain the main flow lines that cross a wall, and calculating the difference in elevation for each. With the slope and length data, I’ve classified the climbing walls by steepness and length, for example from yellow to red (> 45° and > 100m difference in elevation, > 75° and > 900m difference in elevation).\r\n\r\nFinally, the project describes an extra suitability analysis in which I’ve overlaid subjective criteria (distance to roads, rivers, springs, parking) and morphometrical criteria (slope, length) to find out the best climbing wall.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the best climbing wall turned out to be El Capitan, the almost 1km length of the wall and the above 75° steepness have had a big weight in the final overlay model. The coordinates of the resulting point are 37.730285, -119.637618 decimal degrees.",
    "more_details": "Yosemite Valley glacially carved canyon hosts unique vertical geologic resources, like granitic domes, monoliths, spires, and cliffs. El Capitan (1000m tall), Yosemite Falls or Half Dome attract climbers and tourists from all over the world, Camp 4 is regarded as the birthplace of modern rock climbing. There have been numerous studies in the area, regarding rock fall hazards, landslides, and there is a map of the approximate climbing areas, but there were no public maps of the climbing walls. A map of the climbing walls would be useful for climbers to better understand the climbing environment and visualize the routes vicinity.\r\n\r\nThis project is an attempt to delineate the Yosemite climbing walls by creating a high resolution Digital Terrain Model (0.5m), from light detection and ranging data (LiDAR) captured using Airborne scanning. The resolution is a crucial factor in the analysis, lower resolution data would result in smaller walls lengths and less steep slopes, because the values would be interpolated. From the 3D model, we derive raster image files and extract the climbing walls: outline the morphologic characteristics of the ground surface (slope), identify the areas with steep slope above 75° and create a cluster of similar zones using raster image generalization algorithms. Also, we determine the wall length using a flow direction algorithm to obtain the main flow lines that cross a wall, and calculating the difference in elevation for each. With the slope and length data, we classify the climbing walls by steepness and length, for example from yellow to red (> 45° and > 100m difference in elevation, > 75° and > 900m difference in elevation). There is an extra suitability analysis in which we overlay subjective criteria (distance to roads, rivers, springs, parking) to find out the best climbing place.\r\n\r\nThere are still many methods to refine the analysis results and define the climbing walls or to obtain the wall length, correlated with on-site analysis. The project does not analyze the climbing walls in detail, because there is a lack of data from the ‘shadow’ effect that occurs when data is being collected from above the cliffs and overhangs (LiDAR data from the ground, or high resolution photos would be more useful for this kind of analysis). However, the overall result gives a better overview on the existing climbing areas and highlights possible new climbing areas, proving that LiDAR is a valuable resource that can be used with success to examine the surface morphology.",

Using QGIS and D3.js, I have created maps and cartograms, candidates wheel, treemap with counties, and a horizontal bar chart of districts ordered by total valid votes.

That’s why cartograms have been used for Elections maps for a while now, they remove the false impression a vast amount of land with few voters can give in the choropleth maps.        For Romania, a cartogram would have shown clearer how Bucharest, the country capital, had voted. In 2017, there were 2.104.967 residents in Bucharest (9% from the country population), that means approximately 8771 people per square kilometer.",
